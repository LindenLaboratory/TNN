# TNN
The Node Network is a network containing a host and console that allow you to easily make a network that connects multiple devices together to a central server. TNN is the first, less advanced, deviceless version of the [Borealis](https://github.com/LindenLaboratory/Borealis) that was my first look into parallel processing. It is different to Borealis and more efficient in several ways but it is less secure and less useful for general purposes.
